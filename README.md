EEG Concordance in Preterm Twins
================================

Code for manuscript:

`Lloyd RO, O'Toole JM, Livingstone V, Filan PM, Boylan GB, Mathematical analysis of EEG
concordance in perterm twins, 2018, under review`


Please cite the above reference if using this code to generate new results. 


All code developed in _R_ (version 3.4.4, [The R Foundation of Statistical
Computing](http://www.r-project.org)).
EEG features calculated using the NEURAL (version 0.3.3,
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1052811.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1052811),
also available [on github](https://github.com/otoolej/qEEG_feature_set)) with burst
detector (version 0.1.2,
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/42042482.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/42042482),
also available [on github](https://github.com/otoolej/burst_detector)). See
[references](#references) [1,2] for more details on these.


__*NB: feature set (as .csv file) will be included after publication.*__


## Required packages
Mixed-effects models use the `lme4` package (v1.1.15); also `plyr` (v1.8.4) is required
somewhere. 

If not installed, then 

``` R
install.packages('lme4')
install.packages('plyr')
```

## Load the functions

``` R
# load the functions:
source('gen_all_ICC.R')
source('gen_all_ICC_thresholds.R')
source('compare_ICCs_with_thresholds.R')
```

## Intra-class Correlations (ICC)

Generate ICCs using linear mixed-effects models for all EEG
features at all time points, including and not including gestational age, and for the 4
data sets (all twins, MCDA twins, DCDA twins, and singletons):
``` R
gen_all_ICC()
```
This write the ICCs to .csv files (see `set_paths.R` for location).

Then generate the lower-limit threshold for the ICCs, again for all features, at all
time-points, including/not-including gestational age, and for the 4 data sets:
``` R
gen_all_ICC_thresholds("twins")
gen_all_ICC_thresholds("mcda")
gen_all_ICC_thresholds("dcda")
gen_all_ICC_thresholds("singletons")
```
WARNING: this can be slow (e.g. a couple of hours or more). Writes the ICC-thresholds to
.csv files (see `set_paths.R` for location).


Next (optional), to test if the ICCs are significant or not, then compare to the generated
threshold. To do so, load the the data from the .csv files and compare (which writes to
another .csv file):
``` R
compare_ICCs_with_thresholds("twins")
compare_ICCs_with_thresholds("mcda")
compare_ICCs_with_thresholds("dcda")
compare_ICCs_with_thresholds("singletons")
```


## Parameters for the NEURAL toolbox
Parameter values of the [NEURAL](https://github.com/otoolej/qEEG_feature_set) toolbox used
to the generate the qEEG features are listed in the file
[neural_parameters_TWINS.m](neural_parameters_TWINS.m).
